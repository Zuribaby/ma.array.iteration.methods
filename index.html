  <h1> Sum of Array Elements</h1>
  <p>
    Create a program that calculates the sum of all the elements in a given array of numbers. You can use any of the iteration methods discussed above to traverse the array elements and accumulate the sum. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program should output 15 as the sum. This challenge will help you practice array iteration and working with the length property.
